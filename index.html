    <p>You have the biggest sweet tooth 🍨 – ice cream, brownies, milktart, you name it! Pink is definitely your color (just look at this site 💖), and lately you’ve been obsessed with ‘Ordinary’ by Alex Warren. Oh, and thanks for using my birthday-money gift to buy that pink ‘massager’ you really wanted! 😅</p>

    <p>Klerissa, thank you for always putting up with my antics and for being the sunshine in my life. You're truly amazeballs, and I absolutely love your sense of humor (even if I won't admit you're the funniest person I know 😉). You never fail to make me smile – even when I'm teasing you with 'lukka'. Thank you for accepting all of me (yes, even my weird butt-washing habit! 😅). I promise I'll keep trying to be the man you deserve. Happy Birthday, and I love you so much.</p>
